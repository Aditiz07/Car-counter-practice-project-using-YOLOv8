This project implements a real-time car counting system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It accurately detects and counts cars in live CCTV footage, producing bounding boxes around detected cars while ignoring other objects.

Features
Real-time car counting
High accuracy and efficiency
YOLOv8 for robust object detection
OpenCV integration for real-time processing
