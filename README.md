# Real-Time Car Counting Using YOLOv8 and OpenCV
This project implements a real-time car counting system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It accurately detects and counts cars in live CCTV footage, producing bounding boxes around detected cars while ignoring other objects.
Features : Real-time car counting, High accuracy and efficiency, YOLOv8 for robust object detection, OpenCV integration for real-time processing
